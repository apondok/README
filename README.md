THE CODES, I HAVE PROVIDED, WERE WRITTEN BY FACULTY AND STUDENTS OF UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THROUGH THE ASSIGNMENTS.  
I COMBINE AND EDIT CODES AS A PERSONAL PROJECT.  THIS IS A LEARNING PROJECT TO CODE IN JAVA.  I DON'T SELL OR DISTRIBUTE ANY OF THESE CODES AS MY OWN.  
I AM ONLY PRACTICING AND LEARNING DIFFERENT WAYS OF CODING.
